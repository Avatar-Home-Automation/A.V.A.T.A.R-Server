This information page you are reading is in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.
Markdown is the writing format adopted by [GitHub](https://github.com/) for Readme pages. 
Its writing format is very simple and does not require any special knowledge.

This page was automatically generated with the plugin but it is highly recommended to modify it by documenting the pluginâ€™s features.
Use an information file from an existing plugin as an example or visit [http://demo.showdownjs.com](http://demo.showdownjs.com) for writing syntax.

## Voice rules to test the plugin
- test the command 
- test the command in the living room
- test the command in the kitchen

## In the property file:
### "rules":

``` json
"rules": {
	"test": ["test * (command|order)"]
}
```

The syntax (command|order) allows to have a recognition validated with "command" or "order".
To know the possibilities of writing rules, refer to the development documentation.
