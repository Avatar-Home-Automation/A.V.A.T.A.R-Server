This information page you are reading is in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.
Markdown is the writing format adopted by [GitHub](https://github.com/) for Readme pages. 
Its writing format is very simple and does not require any special knowledge.

This page was automatically generated with the plugin but it is highly recommended to modify it by documenting the pluginâ€™s features.
Use an information file from an existing plugin as an example or visit [http://demo.showdownjs.com](http://demo.showdownjs.com) for writing syntax.

## Voice rules to test the plugin
- test the command one
- test the command one in the living room
- test the command one in the kitchen

## In the property file:
### "rules":

``` json
"rules": {
	"test": ["one","1"]
}
```

Any sentence with the terms "1" in the sentence validates the intent of the rule in relation.
For this reason, it is strongly recommended to use the validation of an intention by terms **only** for terms that are not too often likely to be in other sentences.

If you still want to use this possibility and a conflict appears with another rule, you can choose **the order** of validation of the plugin rules.
For more information, refer to the development documentation.

## Le Cron
Cron is short for crontab.
This is a very useful feature for routine tasks.
The Cron object.[module].time of the properties file allows to set the cron of the plugin.
