## 📅 Release Date
12 february 2025

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Randomly, the language verification for translation triggers an error in the `ia` module. Fixed by removing the `languages.isSupported` function, which is not essential for the application's functionality.
- Added a parameter in the _setting.css_ file to fix a display bug caused by the latest update of the `xel` module.
